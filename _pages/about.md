Hello there, I'm Adrian!

I’m an enthusiastic engineer interested in learning and trying new things.

I started my career as a Java developer and then I decided to do a switch towards CI/CD practices. Currently, I’m expanding my knowledge towards the public cloud infrastructure field with AWS and GCP.

When I’m not working I try to travel as much as possible, cook or simply enjoy a book or a movie.

I created this blog to share various solutions for issues I've encountered along the way. I will also create some how-to examples about technologies I find interesting.
